## File Structure

*   `unified-solar-dashboard.php`: The main plugin file.

## How to Use

1.  **Install the plugin:** Upload the plugin files to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install as a zip file through the WordPress admin panel.
2.  **Activate the plugin:** Activate the "Kritim Solar Core" plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3.  **Shortcodes:** The plugin automatically creates the necessary pages with the following shortcodes:
    *   `[unified_solar_dashboard]` on the "Dashboard" page.
    *   `[area_manager_dashboard]` on the "Area Manager Dashboard" page.
    *   `[vendor_registration_form]` on the "Vendor Registration" page.
    *   `[solar_project_marketplace]` on the "Project Marketplace" page.

## How it Works

The plugin creates a `solar_project` custom post type to store all project-related data. It uses custom roles (`solar_client`, `solar_vendor`, `area_manager`) to determine what content to display to the user. All custom fields are handled by native WordPress metaboxes.
